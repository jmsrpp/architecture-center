Data Products in SAP Business Data Cloud serve as a standardized and efficient way to share and consume data across applications and domains. They enable analytic scenarios, AI applications, and facilitate data integration while being optimized for intensive reads. Managed with a product mindset, they are supported by high-quality metadata and governed by decentralized ownership principles.

## Purpose of Data Products

### Key Objectives

**1. Efficient Data Sharing Across Domains**: Data Products facilitate replication-free integration and consumption by SAP, customer, and partner applications via APIs and Events.

**2. Efficient Data Storage**: Data Products are processed and curated in a modern object-store based data lake architecture with highly scalable Spark processing.
      
**3. High-Quality Metadata**: Metadata includes business semantics and is accessible through directories like the Data Product Directory and ORD Aggregators, enhancing discoverability.

**4. Optimized for Analytics**:Data sets are curated for intensive reads and consumed in a read-only fashion, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

**5. Supporting Analytical and AI Applications**: Data Products provide foundational data for dashboards, analytical models, and AI applications.

**6. Decentralized Ownership**: Inspired by Data Mesh principles, Data Products are owned and managed by domain experts or teams responsible for operational data.

**7. Lifecycle Management**: Data Products undergo needs analysis, design, and delivery phases, ensuring their accuracy and relevance.


## Integration and Consumption

Data Products are exposed for consumption via APIs, Events, or [Delta Sharing](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-sharing) protocols. They are described using [Open Resource Discovery (ORD)](https://open-resource-discovery.github.io/specification/) metadata, which includes attributes such as visibility, release status, and integration dependencies. 

### Components of Data Products

**1. Data Aspect**:

   - Includes business objects, analytical data, graph data, and spatial data.
   - Optimized for intensive reads and consumed in a read-only fashion.

**2. API Aspect**:

   - APIs are described with metadata for machine and human-readable documentation.
   - Supports protocols like Delta Sharing and [CSN Interop](https://sap.github.io/csn-interop-specification/).

**3. Metadata Aspect**:

   - ORD Aggregators collect metadata for discoverability.
   - Includes attributes like visibility, integration dependencies, and output ports.

**4. Product Aspect**:

   - Managed with a product mindset, focusing on consumer needs.
   - Includes defined owners responsible for lifecycle and quality.

**5. Business Semantic Aspect**:
   - Describes semantic models using Entity Types, bridging conceptual and technical data models.


## Architecture of Data Products

### Data Sharing View

This diagram illustrates how data is shared between providers and recipients using the Delta Sharing protocol. The Data Provider manages data lake tables and access permissions, which are exposed through a Delta Sharing Server.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Data Provider
        DL[Data Lake Table] --> DS[Delta Sharing Server]
        AP[Access Permissions] --> DS
    end

    DS -- Delta Sharing Protocol --> AC[Any Sharing Client]

    subgraph Data Recipient
        AC
    end
```

### Discovery and Generation Workflow

This diagram shows how data product definitions are discovered and generated. Source Lines of Business (LoB) provide data product definitions, which are read and listed by the SAP Business Data Cloud catalog. These definitions are then used to generate data lake tables, making data products available for consumption.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Source_LoB[Source LoB]
        DP_Def1[Data Product Definitions ORD]
    end

    subgraph SAP_BDC[SAP Business Data Cloud]
        Catalog[Catalog]
        DP_Def2[Data Product Definitions]
        subgraph Data_Lake[Data Lake]
            Data_Lake_Tables["Data Lake Tables"]
        end

        Catalog -->|reads| DP_Def1
        Catalog -->|lists| DP_Def2
        DP_Def2 -->|generates| Data_Lake
    end
```

### Consumption Workflow

This diagram illustrates how consumers discover, integrate, and access data products.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer
    participant ORD Aggregator
    participant Data Product
    Consumer->>ORD Aggregator: 1. Query for Customer Data Product
    ORD Aggregator-->>Consumer: Return Metadata (Input/Output Ports)
    Consumer->>Data Product: 2. Identify Integration Dependencies
    Data Product-->>Consumer: API/Events for Access
    Consumer->>Data Product: 3. Authenticate & Access Resources
```

**Steps**:

   - **1. Discovery**: 
   Consumers query ORD Aggregators to find Data Products and associated metadata.

   - **2. Integration**:
   Consumers establish connections based on integration dependencies (input ports).

   - **3. Consumption**:
   Resources are accessed via APIs or Events defined in output ports.


### Delta Sharing Protocol

Delta Sharing is an open protocol for sharing data stored in cloud-based Data Lake tables. It enables:

- **Zero-Copy Data Access**: No need to move or copy data, ensuring efficient data usage.
- **Central Governance**: Controlled access and scalable sharing.
- **Multi-Tool Support**: Compatible with tools like Apache Spark and Python.

**Workflow**:

1. **Data Provider**:
   - Shares tables/partitions via Delta Sharing Server.
   - Manages access permissions.

2. **Data Consumer**:
   - Uses Delta Sharing clients to authenticate and access data.
   - Temporary URLs facilitate fast, large-scale data transfer.

## Types of Data Products

**SAP-managed vs customer-managed Data Products**:

- Starting with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP is providing a comprehensive set of **SAP-managed data products** across the Lines of Business (LoB). Customer only need to activate these predefined data products and then SAP takes care for extraction, loading and data curation.
- Customer also can create their own **customer-managed data products** to enhance the set of data products with data from any SAP or non-SAP application. Customer-managed data products are curated in SAP Datasphere. The data and ORD file(s) are stored in the customer-managed object store within SAP Datasphere.
- Both type of data products are technically identical. They are stored in an object store, described via ORD file and published in the SAP BDC data catalogue.
   
**Data Packages**:

- Grouping of related SAP-managed Data Products for streamlined onboarding and activation in SAP Business Data Cloud.

:::note 
SAP-managed Data products cannot be activated individually. They only can be activated via Intelligent Application or on data package level. That means that all the data products within the data package or Intelligent Application are activated in one step.
:::

**Primary Data Product (sub type of a data product)**:

- Directly provided from applications, representing original data from source applications.

**Derived Data Product (sub type of a data product)**:

- Curated by SAP and derived from other data sets, delivering value-add based on existing Data Products or APIs.
